# ResumeFolder

Hi, I am Zimeng Ming(Brandon), a fourth year university student who study in combined Computer Science and Statistic in University of Victoria.

I have very high interest on Data Science, Machine Learning, Data mining and Artificial Intelligence especial interact with different types of bussiness. I have attached my resume on the main location of this repository. 

This is the location that I store all my projects. There are two sections, the first one is related to the Data Science projects, the second one is related to the software applications that I have bulit.  Some of the projects are the class work which will under the folder name by the course number. 

My Resume is [here](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/Zimeng%20Ming(Resume)%20.pdf), please feel free to contact me! 

My [Tableau publishes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zimeng.ming) has more visulizations! 

## My Workshops:


1. Data Science projects: 
  *  [Analysis of Unemployment Rate of Canada](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/SENG_474_Data_Mining/Predict_Unemployment_rate_of_Canada) : \
      The project is aiming to analysis the unemployment data from Statistic Canada and try to build the model for the unemployment rate fo Canada. The [final report]((https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/SENG_474_Data_Mining/Predict_Unemployment_rate_of_Canada/474Final_Report.pdf)) contains the details of models and the how the models are created.\
      Toolkits Using:  Python, Pandas, Sklearn with linear model and cluster. \
      [notebook](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/SENG_474_Data_Mining/Predict_Unemployment_rate_of_Canada/474_project_code.ipynb) 
  *  [2020 US Federal President Election Project](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/2020_Election_Data): \
       The project is aiming to  use the Tweeters under specific topics to predict the winners between Biden and Trump. The data was spidered by using Tweepy packages and process with *ELT* to get the clean data.  Once the data process to the *sentiment analysis*, using deep learning algorithm to classify whether the single tweeter is support to Biden, Trump or nuetral. \
       Toolkits Using: Python, Pandas, re, preprocessor, wordcloud, Nltk etc. \

  *  [Covid 19 BC Data](
