# ResumeFolder

Hi, I am Zimeng Ming(Brandon), a data science student who just graduated in combined Computer Science and Statistic in University of Victoria. You also can check me out on my [personal website!](https://brandon0916.github.io/brandonming.github.io/)

I have very high interest on Data Science, Machine Learning, Data mining and Artificial Intelligence especial interact with different types of bussiness. I have attached my resume on the main location of this repository. 

This is the location that I store all my projects. There are two sections, the first one is related to the Data Science projects, the second one is related to the software applications that I have bulit.  Some of the projects are the class work which will under the folder name by the course number. 

My Resume is [here](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/Zimeng%20Ming(Resume)%20.pdf), please feel free to contact me! 

My [Tableau publishes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zimeng.ming) has more visulizations! 

## My Workshops:

1. [2020 WADF Climate data](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/2020_WADF_Climate_Data_Process)
   *  During the time from January,2020 to December,2020, I have joined the reasearch team in Nelson for BC Ministry of FLNR. It is a great time and means a lot of me. I also learn a lot of things about environment data and I participated in building an algorithm for QA/QC the climate dataset. 
   *  There are total 3 stpes for whole process with the combination of script and manually check. The [Presenation](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/2020_WADF_Climate_Data_Process/QAQC%20Process%20Presentation.pdf) is amazing and the [documentation](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/2020_WADF_Climate_Data_Process/QA_QC_for_WADF_Climate_Dataset_Algorithm.pdf) for the details
2. Data Science projects: 
   *  [Analysis of Unemployment Rate of Canada](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/SENG_474_Data_Mining/Predict_Unemployment_rate_of_Canada) : \
       The project is aiming to analysis the unemployment data from Statistic Canada and try to build the model for the unemployment rate fo Canada. The [final report]((https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/SENG_474_Data_Mining/Predict_Unemployment_rate_of_Canada/474Final_Report.pdf)) contains the details of models and the how the models are created.\
       Toolkits Using:  Python, Pandas, Sklearn with linear model and cluster. \
       [notebook](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/SENG_474_Data_Mining/Predict_Unemployment_rate_of_Canada/474_project_code.ipynb) 
   *  [2020 US Federal President Election Project](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/2020_Election_Data): \
        The project is aiming to  use the Tweeters under specific topics to predict the winners between Biden and Trump. The data was spidered by using Tweepy packages and process with *ELT* to get the clean data.  Once the data process to the *sentiment analysis*, using deep learning algorithm to classify whether the single tweeter is support to Biden, Trump or nuetral. \
        Toolkits Using: Python, Pandas, re, preprocessor, wordcloud, Nltk etc. \
        [notebook](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/2020_Election_Data/.ipynb_checkpoints/2020%20Elecion%20Data%20Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb)
   *  [Covid 19 BC Data](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/Covid) : \
         The project is using the Covid-19 cases data from CDC of British Columbia, Visulization the cases distribution and analysis the data with Tableau. \
         Toolkits Using: Python, BeautifulSoup, request, Tableau\
         [notebook](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/Covid/.ipynb_checkpoints/Scraping%20the%20COVID-19%20Data%20from%20Official%20Website-checkpoint.ipynb) \
         [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zimeng.ming/viz/Covid-19_16330301841440/StoryofCovid19)
   *  [SQL Projects](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/CSC_370_SQL_courses) : \
         Here is my SQL practices with course wroks.
   *  MapRecude and Spark

   *  [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/CSC_421_Aritificial_Intelligence) 
   *  [Some R code works](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/DataScience/Statistic_Courses) 
3. Software Porjects
   * [PONGBALL](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/tree/main/SoftwareProjects/PONGBALL) 
        An pygame small application.
   * Flutter Project: 
        I am currently work with a team and we are trying to build a online order app for UBC and UVIC students. We are using the combination of Firebase cloud and flutter to build the whole project. The first version are estimated publishing on later October 2021.         
         

## My current Status

I am currently working with my flutter projects but in the meantime, I am self-study the data science course and do some interesting project either. 

I am also avaliable for a full time job starting on October. Please contact me via email or phone in my [resume](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/Zimeng%20Ming(Resume)%20.pdf)
