# Covid-19 Track Dashboard

At very beginning of the pendemic, I want to use the information that displayed on BC CDC website to bulid a dashboard that can easily show the case number and alert people to avoid the place that may contain risks with Covid-19. However, due to the information restrict, the code has been changed a little.

## Use of the Packages: 

The main language I used is Python with the request and beautifulsoup module. The other help tools is Tableau to display the data in map. 

## Process of the Display:
