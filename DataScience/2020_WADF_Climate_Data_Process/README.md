# This is the Summary for the WADF Work sample folder

During the year 2020, I join the research team on west kooternry boundary region of BC government. I worked with Dr. Natasha Nuemann and Sarah Crookshanks for developing an algorithm to detect the unreliable climate data due to various reasons. There are total of five main test and three steps involved in the whole process by using R. In the end, the algorithm are proofed very effcient and save a lot of work for the future research. 

The [PowerPoints](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/2020_WADF_Climate_Data_Process/QAQC%20Process%20Presentation.pdf) are showing the summary of the work and how the algorithm works.

please see the details in Alogroithm [report](https://github.com/Brandon0916/ResumeFolder/blob/main/DataScience/2020_WADF_Climate_Data_Process/QA_QC_for_WADF_Climate_Dataset_Algorithm.pdf)
