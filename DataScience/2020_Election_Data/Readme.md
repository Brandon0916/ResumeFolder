# 2020 US President Election Project

This Project is created on August 2020, The aim to this project is to learn the basic process of the data science. As due to the first time doing project alone and the dataset are quit large, there are serval problems occurs during this project.

The purpose of the project are using the data scrapt from Tweeter to apply some machine learning models to predict the result of the election. There are serveral training model will applied to the words that the people post on the tweeter. The result that will give to a tweeter for "support" or "not support".

The dataset are driectly scrapt from tweeter with the tweeter developer account. The data will pre-cleaned with serveral ways and the cleaned data will only contains the words.

The python notebook will get the brief instruction of the process that used in the analysis and the use of various methods.

There are total of 4 parts of the data will be extracted from the tweeter, The data that related to the general topics of the election and the topics related to the specific candiantes. The topics "#Biden" and "Trump" are slected to use for general topics. However, although this study are very limited becuase only use one topic for each candiantes but it do conatins large number of the data for each hastages.
This analysis are based on the data that the people post on the tweeter. The project are only used for research.
